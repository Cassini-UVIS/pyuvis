# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 0.6.3

### New Features

- Implement EUV ([#3](https://github.com/Cassini-UVIS/pyuvis/issues/3))
  - just change wmin and wmax from FUV ....

- integrations and n_integrations confusion ([#2](https://github.com/Cassini-UVIS/pyuvis/issues/2))
  - So far I only use n_integrations to calculate how many time entries are required.
But apparently it creates errors or is inconsistent after we convert the name of "integrations" to times. To be investigated.
